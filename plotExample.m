% Matlab help system for details on this
axis ([0 (N+1) -4 4]);

for t=0:dt:T
    
    % Update the values for y
    y = 3*sin(w*t)*y0;
    
    % Update y using the set command and the handle h
    set (h, 'YData', y);
    
    % Pause command so we can see whats happening you can change the delay
    % here to whatever value you like in seconds. Try help pause for more
    % details
    pause(0.01);
